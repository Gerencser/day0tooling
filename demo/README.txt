Jenkins server setup is not scripted
Jenkins needs: terraform, mariadb, ssh support
Jenkins needs: performance test tool


Terraform: one terraform binary

generate ssh private/public key


Only master barnch was usedin git.

Proper AWS user and group security

AMI id is hard coded

file provisioner does not detect file change
thus remote execute cannot be used too

jenkins setup: secrets and their name
terraform, java, mysql,  plugin list, ssh agent and key
